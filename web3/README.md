# ðŸ›¸ Web 3.0

Web 3.0 encompasses the collection and wave of technologies that will help form the next iteration of the internet and the web. Our theory is that identity will play a key role as part of this wave, along with other technologies such as full-functioned Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and Decentralized Finance on public blockchain.

This new wave of technologies will enable a new set of use cases, but it will also have to cover existing use cases addressed by the Web 2.0 web of technologies.
